              Marvel movies have had a tremendous impact all over the world. The millions of people that have watched the franchise expand have been forever affected with the content put before them. Viewers have also been influenced through the films, regarding their opinions and thoughts about the military, potentially without even knowing. 
              In the first ever marvel film, <em>Iron Man</em>, the movie welcomed militarization. In order for Tony Stark to achieve all of his accomplishments, he needed the assistance of the military. Without the military's help, Tony wouldn’t have been able to become Iron Man. Based on this, people watching, who love Iron Man's character, develop a connection with the military because they are a main reason he was created. 
The military had specific goals in mind when funding these films, “in fact, the military reading, approving, and adjusting screenplays is a common practice in Hollywood.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Although it may be unknown to most, the directors and writers don’t have complete say into what is produced on screen. If the military funds part of the movie, which they did for most marvel movies, they have a strong voice in what is portrayed. Opposed to common belief, “these blockbuster films were not intended as propaganda to support specific military engagements; instead, they encouraged audiences to support and put their trust in the military.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Here, it is seen that the military's main goal was to increase their public reputation. The psychology behind it is quite smart. Kids growing up, who are soon to be part of the working class, fall in love with these marvel characters. Knowing that these characters support the military, will subconsciously cause you to support them as well. For example, take Captain America, a true American patriot. Every child, whose favorite character in marvel is Captain America, will want to follow in his footsteps and put trust where he does. Using marvel characters to gain trust was a strategic approach in connecting with a larger audience and using fictional characters to convey a real message. 
Marvel movies were beginning to take off in the early 2010s and began to attract more and more viewers. Knowing this information, the military used it to their advantage in hopes of changing American culture, “one way in which Hollywood was able to perform this cultural transformation was to tie superheroes into the wave of popular support for militarization in post-9/11 America.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>  America was heartbroken after the 9/11 attacks and felt that there was action that needed to take place, action that the military needed to perform. Again, the military used the marvel franchise to promote themselves. <em>The Avengers</em> aired the following year after 9/11 and it included many signs of military promotion. In the movie, the avengers rely on the military for transportation, resources, shelter, and advice. Without the help of the military in the movie, the avengers wouldn't have been able to succeed, “the shift of the avengers from being self-managed to a team that needs a military structure to perform optimally is a major shift.”<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> The avengers were “earth's mightiest heroes” and if these heroes needed the military to succeed, all of America should put their trust in the military as well. The goal of this shift was to improve the cooperation between the average American citizen and the military. 
Overall, the military used a variety of methods to convey their message to the public. All of their messages wanted the American people to trust and support the military, more than they already were doing so. The military used marvel to their advantage and created a better world for themselves using the world our heroes live in.
