        <h1>The Military's Role in Captain America: The First Avenger</h1>
            <p>
                Believe it or not, the military plays a large role in funding movies and television productions. Throughout the marvel franchise, the military had partially financed many movies, especially Captain America: The First Avenger. The question at stake is, why would the military have any desire to spend their resources on big screen entertainment, as opposed to defenses, training, or new technology? The answer is quite simple; to promote their publicity and image. 
             </p> 
        
            <p>
                By funding part of the movie, the military has a vote in what is portrayed on screen. In the film, we can clearly see an excessive amount of American patriotism and even inaccurate representations of the military during World War II, the time period in which the movie takes place.To present themselves in a brighter way, the military made sure that Marvel didn’t segregate its battalions. While it is true that during the war soldiers were seperated by race, in the movie, we see people of all races and religions fighting together as one.

                Another major reason that the military had the desire to use their resources on Captain America: The First Avenger was they believed that the movie “possesses the value of today's modern soldier”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
. Not only does the military want to increase their image, but they also want to encourage potential members into enlisting. Their hope was that after watching the movie, people who were on the fence of whether or not to join, would receive that extra motivation and take the next step forward. 
        </p>
                Lastly, the military wanted to fund this movie because it gave them access to the character creation and development of Captain America. They worked with marvel to create the best possible soldier, in terms of his looks, personality, morals, beliefs, and patriotism. Captain America is described as the “perfect soldier”, which is exactly what the military wanted him to be represented as. 
        <p>
                Overall, the military uses big screen entertainment to promote themselves and their self image to the world. Also, they use it to cover up their historical weak points, in order to represent themselves as what they wish they were at the time, compared to the actual reality. It is a smart idea for the military to use the big screen as a method of promotion, but raises a final thought of what else we’ve seen on the television about the military that strays far away from the truth.
