        <h1>Recruitment</h1>
            <p>
              Right now, the U.S. Military has 1,417,370 active members, making it the third largest military in the world. The only two places that have a larger military are China and India. Both China and India have approximately 1.4 billion people living there, whereas the United States has 330 million. Looking at the percentage of people who are soldiers in each country, there is a significant difference. In China, the population is 1.4 billion and there are 2 million active soldiers, making 0.14% of the population active in the military. India has 1.4 billion people, with an army of 1.45 million, causing 0.073% of the population to be active military. In the United States, there are 1.39 million soldiers, out of a 330 million population, meaning that 0.42% of people are active military members. It is clear that the U.S. military has a significantly higher rate of people in the military compared to other countries. One of the major reasons for this is their recruitment opportunities and process.

                While the U.S. military has a great deal of recruitment programs, one that isn’t talked about much, but effective is the use of the entertainment business, specifically the marvel franchise. One movie that emphasizes this was <em>Captain Marvel</em>. In this movie we are shown how, “military training empowers, even provides a ground on which women can prove their equality to men…”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Captain Marvel is a prime example because she uses the military to prove her worth and eventually becomes more valuable than any of the other people serving in the military alongside her. The goal of this was for people to see that the military is a place to establish yourself and feel valued. They had hoped that watching Captain Marvel rise to the occasion and prove her value would inspire others in the audience to do the same. This movie frames ideas about ethics and how the military is the perfect place to reshape those prolonged, false, and inaccurate gender roles. Also, “Task and Purpose described it as a ‘dream recruitment tool’ for the Air Force. Even the first trailer closely resembles real-life military ads with their narrative of transformations after joining the military.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> Task and Purpose is an American online publication that covers the United States Armed Forces. They describe the movie as a “dream recruitment tool” because of the promises it entails. Based on what is shown in the film, a large percentage of people would want to go through the same experience as Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel).

                In <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>, we see when Tony is recruiting Peter, Spider Man, he “mirrors the military’s recruiting rhetoric of promising to bring out the best of his abilities and teach Spider Man how to best utilize his powers.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Here, Tony uses a military process of recruitment by promising to bring the best out of Peter, which the military would promise its new recruits. The military would promise to elevate every soldier's skills and be the best opportunity for them to reach their full potential. As the audience watched Spider Man accept Iron Man's proposal, the military would hope that those on the fence of joining the military, will follow in the footsteps of heroes and trust the military process.

                Throughout the entirety of the franchise, over the span of dozens of movies, the military asks a simple task of the American public and that is to “trust in military expertise, just as the superheros do.” The military uses the symbolism of marvel superheros and frames it into positive publicity. Using marvel heroes, the U.S. military is able to recruit a higher amount of willing people and create a stronger army.
